# ðŸ’¿ Libre-Image-Writer
A minimalist GUI application for burning ISO's to a disk. Written in python. Total size 2.83 KB. Contributions welcome. 

<h2> Installation: </h2>
1. Download the img.py file.

2. Make sure you have the package 'tk' (Tkinter) installed. It comes preinstalled with most installations of Python but you can install it like [this](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html).
 
3. Run 'python3 /Path/To/img.py'

<h2> What and Why? </h2>
When you're planning to write an ISO to a disk, you have two options. Either go hunting for an obscure [possibly proprietary and privacy-invasive] program, or use the 'dd' command that comes preinstalled on most Unix-based systems. The latter may seem like a good idea, until you realize that even a slight mistype in the syntax could lead to you accidentally writing over your entire hard disk or choosing the wrong file to write. 

This is an alternative to them. It provides a clean GUI to choose the correct ISO file and disk, while taking up less than 3 KB. Its only dependencies are Python 3, and the 'dd' tool [both come preinstalled on Unix systems]. 

<h2> Philosophy </h2>

Quoting the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html);

"_Free software means that the software's users have freedom. (The issue is not about price.) ..._

_... Specifically, free software means users have the four essential freedoms: (0) to run the program, (1) to study and change the program in source code form, (2) to redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions._

_Software differs from material objectsâ€”such as chairs, sandwiches, and gasolineâ€”in that it can be copied and changed much more easily. These facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program's users should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer._"

What they said.

<h2> About code contributions </h2>

ALL, and I repeat ALL, contributions are welcome. If you know how to code, perhaps you could make the code more efficient, fix a bug, develop new logic for the script. If you don't know how to code, maybe you could tell others about this, maybe you could make art for our cover image, maybe *you could just use it*. 

Even if it's a very insignificant one, I welcome and appreciate all contributions. 

<h2> Future objectives</h2>

There are 3 main objectives for this project;

1. To make a version that is compatible with the [Windows operating system](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html) [to help people switch to Linux :) ]

2. To get this script into the main software repositiories, specifically :- [homebrew](brew.sh), [apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt), and the [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/). 

3. To get over 100 stars on GitHub. I truly see a need for this piece of software, and I want people to know about it. 

<h2>That's all. </h2>
Bye!
