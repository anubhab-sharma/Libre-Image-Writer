# ðŸ’¿ Libre-Image-Writer
A minimalist GUI application for burning ISO's to a disk. Written in python. Total size 2.83 KB. Contributions welcome. 

<h2> Instructions: </h2>

1. Download the img.py file
2. Run 'python 3 /Path/To/img.py'

<h2> Things to keep in mind.</h2>
1. It needs python 3 and the 'dd' tool to be installed. [Both typically come preinstalled on most Unix systems]

2. It does not work on Windows, as the 'dd' tool is not present on Windows. A reliable alternative for Windows is Rufus [rufus.ie]. However, Rufus is MUCH larger than this script. 

3. This will forever be completely free [as in freedom] to use and will NEVER have analytics or bloat.
